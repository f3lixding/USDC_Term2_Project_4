## General Steps to Tuning
1. Manual Tuning.
2. Using Twiddle to fine-tune parameters one at a time.

## Tuning Result
The final paraters are as follows:
Kp = 0.2
Ki = 0.003
Kd = 4.53

## Tuning Breakdown
* Kp is directly multiplied onto the cte error. The p_error is directly proportional how far the car is away from the center. This is tuned via observing the degree to which the car oscillates. I started from zero, and gradually increase it until the car is oscillating too much, and I dial it back down.
* Ki represents the "lurking error" that exists within the system. It can be understood as a correction factor to compensate the difference between what the system thinks it is currently outputting versus what it is actually outputting. This term is more relevant under circumstances that involves uncalibrated hardware. Since the actual output of the car matches closely with the input in the simulator, the term is given very little weight.
* Kd is the weight given to the derivative term. This term gives the PID controller the capacity to factor in the rate of change. If the car is quickly steering away from the center, this term will compensate by increasing the correction in a similar fashion. On the other hand, should the car steer toward the center too quickly and subsequently puts the car in the danger of oversteering, this term will quickly decrease the steering value so the car approaches its target smoothly.

The throttle was also given a new control scheme. It was observed that the car would sometimes steer off the road even though it is steering to the correct direction. I decided to give the car more time to react to similar situation. This is done via making the throttle inversely proportional to the amount of steering executed. This greatly improved the car's chances to make it around aforementioned corners. 

Twiddle was only really used for the last coefficient. I found that twiddle is very sensitive to the duration to which it is given to work. And it is very easy for it to sink into an local minima that is not at all representitive to the track in its entirety.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
